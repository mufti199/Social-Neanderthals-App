# Social-Neanderthals-App
A social media web application similar to Twitter, but customized for neanderthals.

Hosted through Google Firebase, at https://social-app-da7be.web.app/ .\
The project is aimed to mimic a few of Twitters primary features on a small scale, with more features added on regular intervals.

**Current features:**
- Authentication
- Profile
- Scream (Tweet/Post)
- NewsFeed (currently only 'global' available)
- Like, Unlike and Comment
- Notifications

**Upcoming features:**
- Delete Comment (currently only screams can be deleted)
- Demo feature (for those who don't want to sign up yet)
- Follow feature (NewsFeed will be shifted to 'following')

## Acknowledgments

Documentation and tutorials from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and [Ahmed Hadjou](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-slOJImuSc20Drbf88qvg) have been extensively used in making the foundational design and application.\
It is highly recommended to check the documentation for each component as they are being constantly developed and a number of things now differ form the two above mentioned sources.

This application took many inspirations from Ahmed Hadjou's [social-ape-app](https://github.com/hidjou).\

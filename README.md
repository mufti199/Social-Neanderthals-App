## Acknowledgments

Documentation and tutorials from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and [Ahmed Hadjou](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-slOJImuSc20Drbf88qvg) were primarily used in the making of this appilcation. The project is essentially a remodelled version of Ahmed Hadjou's [social-ape-app](https://github.com/hidjou), but built completely from the ground up.
It is also highly emphasised to check the documentation for each component as they are being constantly developed and a number of things now differ form the two primary documnetations.
